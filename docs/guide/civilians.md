It is even rumored some among them are great philosphers, whose wisdom might change your life!  
As instability in the town increases the locals will become more active, beginning to take your message of resistance to heart.

## Civilian Interactions

### Ask About Intel

Civilians will know about nearby locations through word of mouth, or personal experience.  
Certainly all will know if the town has a police station, and most will know about military locations within a few km of the town.  
They are not informed about the movements of enemy troops though.  

### Instigate

You should always make sure the civilians are aware of the struggle, you will find they are just waiting for an invitation to support your cause.  
This will help to increase the local instability.  

## Special Civilians

As instability rises you will notice civilians becoming more actively engaged with the revolution.  

### Lone Fighters

Some civilians may take up arms against their oppressors.  
They will join you in your actions in their town if you ask them.  
If you leave the town they will leave you.  

### Explosives Enthusiasts

What they lack for in electrical engineering skills, they make up for in enthusiasm for your cause.  
You can identify them by their purposeful walk and suspicious backpack.  
They are open to suggestions on how to best deploy their handy work, or even on giving it over to the cause.  
Generally they will target the area around the local police station, nearby military vehicles, or good roadside spots.  
In the former two cases they will detonate as soon as they reach a safe distance, in the later they will wait for enemies to be within range.  
If you direct them to a location yourself, they will plant a roadside bomb there, and wait for enemies to near it before detonating.  
They will not infrequently make a mistake while planting their bomb, and accidentally detonate it before they are clear.
