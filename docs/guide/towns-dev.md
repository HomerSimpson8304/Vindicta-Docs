## Influence

Towns have influence value.

Influence ranges from -100% to +100%. Positive means that rebels have influence over this town, negative means that enemy forces have influence over this town.

Friendly influence can be increased by:

- Releasing captive civilians
- Inciting civilians through dialogues.
- Killing enemy soldiers near town
- Destroying enemy vehicles near town

Enemy influence increases when:

- Civilians are killed
- Civilian vehicles are destroyed
- Friendly forces are killed near town

Influence of a side increases with time if that side occupies a town.

If a town is not occupied by any side, enemy influence slowly increases over time.

## Occupying a town

Town is occupied when a garrison is attached to it. Occupying town gives benefits:

- Influence slowly increases.
- Recruitment rate increases.
- Maximum recruit count increases.

## Recruit count

Towns have separate values for friendly and enemy recruit count. Recruit count grows of a side grows proportionally with influence value. Recruit count can't be bigger than a certain value, which is bigger for bigger cities.

## Enemy recruitment

Enemy commander will refill its manpower only by recruiting civilians from towns. Enemies can recruit soldiers at airports, outposts and bases. Soldiers are recruited from cities further away from war zone, if possible.

## Strategy

It's crucial to hold cities from enemy influence to maintain soldier income.
