## Instability

This is a measure of how much progress you have made in convincing the town to join your cause.  
It relates directly to the recruitment rate of the city.  
Instability changes cause the town to move through a set of states.

## States

Towns have 5 disctinct states: Stable, Agitated, In Revolt, Liberated, and Suppressed.

### Stable

Stable towns are those which have yet to fall under your influence. They will produce no recruits, and police action will be low.  
To begin the process of liberating the town you should talk to the locals, or engage in operations against any local governmental forces.  

### Agitated

When instability begins to rise town will become agitate.  
The local population will begin to rise up against their oppressors.  
Some may take up arms: they can be recruited into your squad, or left to their own devices. If you recruit them into your squad be aware that they will 
leave when you get far enough from the town, and return home.  

### In Revolt

At high levels of instability the town will enter open revolt against the govermental forces.  
There will be street fighting, attempted assasinations of police, road side bombs, all hell breaking loose.  
If you can find the bombers you can direct their actions, or request their IEDs for your own purposes.  

### Liberated

Once instability reaches 100% the town can be liberated. For this to happen your forces must out number enemies in the town by 2 to 1. 
A liberated town may spawn friendly police, and will no longer be the target of police reinforcements.  

### Suppressed

If the enemy occupies a liberated town it will become suppressed.  
While suppressed the towns instability will revert to 0%, and you will gain no recruits there.  
You can re-liberate the town using your own forces, again by out numbering the enemy 2 to 1.
