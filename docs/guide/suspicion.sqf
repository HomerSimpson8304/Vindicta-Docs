# Suspicion
{: .no_toc }

Suspicion is a measure of how enemies view you.  
Actions, appearences, and locations have levels of suspicion associated with them.  
The suspicion is cumulative, meaning that if you are performing a suspicious action, 
while in a suspicious location, you will be subject to the sum of the suspicion of them both.  
Suspicion can change rapidly or over time, depending on the cause.

## Suspicion States

### Undercover

While suspicion remains below 50% you will be undercover. In this state enemies will ignore you entirely.  

### Suspicious

When suspicion is above 50% but below 100% you will be suspicious. Enemies may try to arrest you when you are in this state.  

### Overt

When suspicion hits 100% you will become overt. Enemies will shoot you on sight.  

## Sources of Suspicion

### Actions

Suspicious actions include:
- Discussing "sensitive" matters with civilians.
- Running

### Appearences

Suspicion is highly influenced by appearence.  
Suspicious appearence can be caused by:
- A weapon of any kind (duh)
- Military clothing of any kind
- Military backpacks
- Helmets
- Driving military vehicles
- Nightvision

### Locations

This one is simple: being in military or police locations is suspicious. Being in them while driving is liable to get you immediately shot.
