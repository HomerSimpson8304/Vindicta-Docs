# Police

Most [towns]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /guide/towns.html %}) will have a police presence from the start of the campaign.  
They are generally lightly armed, and limited in numbers.  
They will take actions against you (and other civilians) if provoked.  

## Police Station

Towns with a police presence will also have a local police station.  
This will generally be lightly manned, and contain crates with basic police equipment and some building supplies.  

## Police Reinforcements

When taking casualties the police will call in reinforcements.  
These reinforcements are in-exaustable.  
The only way to stop them is to stop killing the police, kill them all quickly enough that they cannot call for reinforcements, or to [liberate the town]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /docs/guide/towns.md %}).
