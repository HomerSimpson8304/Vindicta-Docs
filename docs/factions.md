## AAF
The <b>Altis Armed Forces (or simply the AAF)</b> are an Independent faction in ArmA 3, forming the main military force of the <b>Republic of Altis and Stratis</b>.


After a military coup in 2026, they wage a long and bloody civil war first against the pro-civilian government loyalist forces and later, against the Freedom and Independence Army insurgency group which leads to the events of The East Wind campaign.

<details><summary>History</summary>
<p>
  
Covertly backed by foreign powers, a high-ranking military officer by the name of Georgious Akhanteros leads a coup in an attempt to seize power from the civilian government of Altis. The coup d'etat is swift, with Akhanteros and his supporters effectively forming a junta that silences any political opposition groups and violently crushes all protests.


This act ultimately led to the start of a bloody civil war between Akhanteros' hardline AAF, and pre-coup loyalist forces (predecessors of the present-day FIA) who sought to re-establish civilian control of the country. The fighting would continue to last a total of four more years until the signing of Jerusalem Cease Fire of 2030, which brought a halt to the bloodshed.


The agreement was largely one-sided however, as the AAF had emerged victorious while the loyalists were rendered completely irrelevant by the war's end. As well as bringing a conclusive end to the fighting, the agreement gave global recognition to Akhanteros' cabinet as the legitimate government of the Republic of Altis and Stratis.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Equipment</summary>
<p>
  
Most of the AAF's hardware consists of outdated or long-since decommissioned for service equipment used by NATO forces. Troopers wear a mixture of early 21st century U.S. Army ACU-style uniforms patterned in a fractal digital green camouflage, while standard-issue combat helmets are old PASGT helmets that have been modified to mount night vision goggles.

The service rifle of all AAF troopers and support personnel is the Mk20 bullpup assault rifle that is chambered to fire the 5.56 mm NATO cartridge. For additional or precision firepower, the AAF also utilises the Mk200 light machine gun and Mk18 ABR battle rifle for either role (respectively).

At both the squad and company level, AAF weapon teams utilise the Titan MPRL for anti-aircraft purposes, while the Titan MPRL Compact, PCML, and MAAWS Mk4 Mod 0 launchers are used for anti-tank/anti-vehicle duties. On occasion, even CSAT RPG-42s have been utilised by AAF AT troopers; though generally in fewer numbers due to the prevalence of the PCML and MAAWS Mk4 launchers instead.<br>

## LDF (Next Update)
The <b>Livonian Defense Force (shortened to LDF)</b> is an Independent faction in ArmA 3. It was added with the release of the Contact DLC.

<details><summary>History</summary>
<p>
  
The collapse of the Soviet Union paved the way for Livonia regaining its independence in 1991. Towards the start of the 21st century, the country would also become an official member of the NATO alliance. Since then, the Livonian Defense Force has participated in numerous deployments alongside its allies throughout the globe.


As tensions with Livonia's neighbours continue to rise in light of CSAT expansionism in nearby Belarus, the LDF's role has transitioned to safeguarding the nation's borders against potential infiltration attempts from both the Russian Federation and Belarus.

In recent years, safeguarding the nation's borders against Russian/Belorussian subversion attempts has become top priority of both the LDF and its allies' agenda.


In late 2035, the Livonian government reached an agreement with its NATO partners to have the biennial "Electron" joint training exercises be held on a consistent basis in the country's semi-abandoned Nadbór region.


The latest of the exercises, Electron-39, will begin on June 17th, 2039. It will be the largest exercise yet, with over 25,000 personnel from both the LDF and its allies participating.


The LDF and their allies will be alternating between roleplaying as the aggressor force, simulating an armed incursion by the Russian military into the so-called "Andrzejów Gap" region.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Equipment</summary>
<p>
  
As an active member of the NATO alliance, the LDF's soldiers are well-equipped with some of the latest in Western-made hardware and electronics.


Conventional Livonian infantry don combat fatigues, ballistic helmets and plate carrier vests coloured in either a plain olive green colour or concealed with the LDF's distinctive "geometric" woodland camouflage pattern.


Non-combat support troops on the other hand, often wear lighter versions of the standard fatigues but only don bandoliers or lightweight bullet-resistant vests instead. On the rare occasion that NBC safety is required, military scientists and regular soldiers wear full-body protective suits and respirators designed to shield them against contamination from biological/chemical agents.


While the majority of ground troops have access to night vision equipment like their American and British counterparts, only the LDF's elite special operations units and pathfinders are given ENVG-II multi-vision goggles.

## NATO
The <b>North Atlantic Treaty Organization (alternately known as the North Atlantic Alliance and shortened to NATO or OTAN in French)</b> is a multi-national BLUFOR faction that has been featured in ArmA: Cold War Assault, ArmA 2 and ArmA 3.

<details><summary>History</summary>
<p>
  
Two decades of geopolitical turmoil after the events of Operation Arrowhead have seen a drastic reduction to NATO's influence on world affairs.


In the subsequent power vacuum, the Canton Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty (CSAT), a coalition of Eastern nations led by the People's Republic of China, has risen to assume its place.

Economic issues continue to plague many of the core NATO members. A two decade-long depression in the United States, as well as throughout the European continent, has set into motion an irreversible dwindling of Western European soft power.


Germany, once considered the economic heart of Europe, suffers from a staggering 33% unemployment rate while other European countries average higher at 42%. Mass rioting in capital cities occur on a regular basis, necessitating the deployment of soldiers and often culminating in bloodshed.


The U.S. has been equally impacted by the depression, with its economy shrinking at the turn of every financial quarter. Combined with constant military defeats in proxy wars against China in the Asia-Pacific region, and elsewhere in the globe, these losses have contributed to a sharp rise in isolationist sentiments.


With the alliance collectively struggling to tackle domestic issues, many of its members have opted to shy away from foreign deployments. This has resulted in the U.S. being stretched thin militarily, and unable to secure its traditional spheres of influence against CSAT expansionism.


Prior to the start of the events of The East Wind, the alliance has already been severely fragmented. Several Southern European nations are facing total economic collapse, while many of its Eastern European members have opted to leave the organisation on the promise of receiving Russian oil.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Equipment</summary>
<p>
  
Predominately consisting of infantrymen from the U.S. Army, NATO forces wear plate carriers and helmets which offer decent protection to the head and torso at the cost of storage capacity.


Conventional troops wear a mixture of light and blast-resistant carrier vests. Squad leaders and some specialist troops on the other hand, prefer to don special plate carriers made out of ceramic materials. Combat helmets range from Light, Enhanced and Camouflaged variants, which are standard issue across all NATO forces.

Soldiers deployed to the Mediterranean theatre wear MTP-camouflaged uniforms with ranger green-coloured vests and a variety of spraypainted helmets, while soldiers operating in the Pacific are issued Tropic-camouflaged uniforms, vests and headgear instead.


Lastly, troops based in mainland Europe utilise Woodland-camouflaged uniforms and personal gear specially tailored for the heavily-forested landscapes of Eastern Europe.


Depending on whether NBC threats to humans are present, MOPP gear may also be distributed to line infantry in the form of protective suits and respirators with gas masks. Intended to shield them against the hazards of a contaminated battlefield, these cumbersome (but essential) pieces of equipment are available to all NATO forces regardless of the region they operate in.

</p>

## CSAT
The <b>Canton Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty (alternately CSAT for short, and in Simplified Chinese: 广东条约战略联盟组织)</b> is an OPFOR faction in ArmA 3.


They are a military and economic alliance that consists of Eastern nations, and serve as a direct counterpart to NATO.


The bulk of the coalition's military might is divided up into different forces depending on the region that they operate in; as of current, this consists of Mediterranean (Altis), Pacific (Tanoa), and North African (Malden) branches.

<details><summary>History</summary>
<p>
  
CSAT's meteoric rise takes place amidst the backdrop of a two decade-long economic depression throughout the European Union and the United States.


While its geopolitical adversaries remain bogged down by domestic issues, CSAT's members have been bolstered by decades of unparalleled growth and technological advancement.


Every year, Western and Eastern nations alike continue to seek membership in the hopes of gaining a share in the bloc's prosperity. The latest summits, first held in the Syrian capital of Damascus and in Russia's Moscow later that year, have already gained the coalition several new members.


In Southern Europe, countries suffering from harsh austerity measures imposed by the EU have turned to seek investments and humanitarian aid relief from the Republic of Iran. Meanwhile in the Asia-Pacific region, military victories in proxy wars against the U.S. has allowed China to maintain full dominance over the South China Sea.


Even as the 2030s draw to a close, its Western rivals remain convinced that CSAT's rise can be halted. But with each year's passing, the coalition's influence and reach only continues to strengthen; its ascension to status of being the world's premier superpower, very much appears to be inevitable.


NOTE: Though their exact date of formation has never been outright stated, it can be surmised that the organisation has been in existence for at least a decade prior to the events of The East Wind, as they were actively involved with the events of the Altian Civil War and also influencing Malden in the 2020s.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Equipment</summary>
<p>
  
CSAT equipment is predominately made up of assets acquired from various countries; namely Russian arms manufacturers. Iranian and Chinese defence industries have also collaborated heavily in order to reverse engineer several weapons systems that are of both Eastern and Western design in origin.


Nonetheless, their forces utilise extremely advanced hardware that is on par with, if not superior to, their Western counterparts in almost every way.


For example, Iranian/Chinese CSAT soldiers are unique for their armoured fatigues which consist of two components; an over-suit camouflaged in their signature Hexacam pattern (for arid, urban, and tropical environments) and a bullet-resistant under-suit that is designed to provide ballistic protection from neck to toe against small arms calibres ranging up to 7.62 mm.


Because their fatigues are armoured by default, CSAT soldiers eschew the need for plate carriers like their NATO/AAF counterparts and can wear load bearing vests instead - allowing them to carry much more ammunition and equipment (certain specialist troops still opt to wear tactical vests).

On the other hand, their Defender/Protector/Assassin helmets provide the best ballistic protection and surface coverage out of all modern combat helmets.


However, it should be noted that not all CSAT forces are equally equipped to the same standards as their Iranian/Chinese counterparts.


North African troops stationed on the island of Malden for instance, only wear unarmoured light fatigues and chest rigs - both of which lack ballistic protection. Likewise, many do not have access to combat helmets and only wear simple ball/military caps for headwear.


While on deployments, CSAT soldiers do not wear the flag patches of their home nation, and instead bear the six red hexagons of the CSAT emblem.

## [WW2 Heer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1980236949)
The <b>German Army (German: Heer. Army)</b> was the land forces component of the Wehrmacht, the regular German Armed Forces, from 1935 until it ceased to exist in 1945 and then formally dissolved in August 1946. During World War II, a total of about 13.6 million soldiers served in the German Army. Army personnel were made up of volunteers and conscripts.

<details><summary>History</summary>
<p>

Only 17 months after Adolf Hitler announced publicly the German rearmament program, the army reached its projected goal of 36 divisions. During the autumn of 1937, two more corps were formed. In 1938 four additional corps were formed with the inclusion of the five divisions of the Austrian Army after the Anschluss in March. During the period of its expansion under Hitler, the German Army continued to develop concepts pioneered during World War I, combining ground and air assets into combined arms forces. Coupled with operational and tactical methods such as encirclements and "battle of annihilation", the German military managed quick victories in the two initial years of World War II, a new style of warfare described as Blitzkrieg (lightning war) for its speed and destructive power.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Equipment</summary>
<p>

It is a myth that the German Army in World War II was a mechanized juggernaut as a whole. In 1941, between 74 and 80 percent of their forces were not motorized, relying on railroad for rapid movement and on horse-drawn transport cross country. The percentage of motorization decreased thereafter. In 1944 approximately 85 percent was not motorized. The standard uniform used by the German Army consisted of a Feldgrau (field grey) tunic and trousers, worn with a Stahlhelm.<br>


The German Army was known to be using lots of captured Soviet, USA, UK equipment, a grate example of such usage was Panzer Brigade 150 which used captured USA and UK tanks.


The Germans used a number of type designations for their weapons. Usually, the type designation and series number (i.e. FlaK 30) are sufficient to identify a system, but occasionally multiple systems of the same type are developed at the same time and share a designation, at which point one must reference the calibre to differentiate.

## [WW2 UK](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1980236949)
At the start of 1939 the <b>British Army</b> was a small volunteer professional army. At the beginning of the Second World War, 3 September 1939, the British Army was small in comparison to its enemies, as it had been in the First World War. It also quickly became evident that the initial structure and manpower of the British Army were woefully unprepared and ill-equipped for a war with multiple enemies on multiple fronts.

<details><summary>History</summary>
<p>

During the early war years the British Army suffered defeat in almost every theatre of war in which it was deployed. But from 1943, starting with the Tunisian Campaign, fortunes changed and the British Army never suffered another strategic defeat, despite some tactical failures (most notably the Battle of Arnhem in September 1944). While there are a number of reasons for this shift, not least the USA joining the Allies from 8 December 1941, an important factor was the stronger British Army. This included better equipment and training, better military intelligence and mass conscription that allowed the British Army to expand to form larger armies and army groups, as well as create new specialist formations such as the Special Air Service, Special Boat Service, Commandos and the Parachute Regiment. Eight men would be promoted to the rank of Field Marshal to command these new armies. By the end of the Second World War 2.9 million men had served in the British Army which had suffered about 300,000 military deaths and 376,239 wounded.

British Army used lots of different equipment bought from the USA or mostly self-made. British Army rarely used captured German equipment.

The <b>Arma 3 Police (or Gendarmerie)</b> is a BLUFOR faction in ArmA 3. It was added with the release of the Apex DLC.

<details><summary>History</summary>

The police forces are different all around the world, but this police department is realy interesting since it's basically the copy of Horizon Islands Gendarmerie.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Equipment</summary>
<p>

Equipment used by gendarmes isn't the best quality and price mostly because the lack of founding from the government and the poor performance of the officers. The weapons they use are mostly pistols with few submachine guns. There ballistic protection is really poor only small amount of gendarmes wears Bulletproof vests. To this day there isn't a Special Police Force in this department so officers usually use the Basic Ballistic Helmets and Raven Vests for their needs.

The <b>Altis Police Department (or simply the APD)</b> is a police force heavily supported by the US government with equipment and training.

<details><summary>History</summary>
<p>

The original police force of Altis was formed in 1819 which was later reformed after US intervention in Mediterranean. Under US occupation of the island the "Grate Reform" of Republic of Altis and Stratis started, focusing on reforming the government and political system. One of the biggest questions was the law system in the small republic. The President of USA and the newly elected President of Republic of Altis and Stratis chose to adapt the "US police style" force, while not changing the base law system.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Equipment</summary>
<p>

The US government heavily invested in the new APD supporting them with new uniforms, vests, guns, cars. The new police equipment consists of uniform with blue t-shirt with black pants, black police belt, black bulletproof vest, usually a 9 mm pistols but there are still weapons from past the "Grate Reform" used. Most of the police stations have long weapons for use by the officers. Commonly found long weapons in police arsenal are M16, M4, M4A1 alongside some simple weapon attachments. Some stations also have the support of the long range weapons such as M24 Sniper Rifle. The APD is constantly being trained by USAF, so we expect this police force getting even better.

## [WW2 Heer Police (SS)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1980236949)
The <b>Schutzstaffel (SS; also stylized as ᛋᛋ with Armanen runes)</b> was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in Nazi Germany, and later throughout German-occupied Europe during World War II.

<details><summary>History</summary>
<p>

The two main constituent groups were the Allgemeine SS (General SS) and Waffen-SS (Armed SS). The Allgemeine SS was responsible for enforcing the racial policy of Nazi Germany and general policing, whereas the Waffen-SS consisted of combat units within Nazi Germany's military. A third component of the SS, the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), ran the concentration camps and extermination camps. Additional subdivisions of the SS included the Gestapo and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) organizations. They were tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi state, the neutralization of any opposition, policing the German people for their commitment to Nazi ideology, and providing domestic and foreign intelligence.


The SS was the organization most responsible for the genocidal killing of an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews and millions of other victims during the Holocaust. Members of all of its branches committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during World War II (1939–45). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as slave labor. After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the NSDAP were judged by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg to be criminal organizations. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, was found guilty of crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.

</p>
