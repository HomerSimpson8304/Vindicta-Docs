## AAF
The <b>Altis Armed Forces (or simply the AAF)</b> are an Independent faction in ArmA 3, forming the main military force of the <b>Republic of Altis and Stratis</b>.

After a military coup in 2026, they wage a long and bloody civil war first against the pro-civilian government loyalist forces and later, against the Freedom and Independence Army insurgency group which leads to the events of The East Wind campaign.

### History
Covertly backed by foreign powers, a high-ranking military officer by the name of Georgious Akhanteros leads a coup in an attempt to seize power from the civilian government of Altis. The coup d'etat is swift, with Akhanteros and his supporters effectively forming a junta that silences any political opposition groups and violently crushes all protests.

This act ultimately led to the start of a bloody civil war between Akhanteros' hardline AAF, and pre-coup loyalist forces (predecessors of the present-day FIA) who sought to re-establish civilian control of the country. The fighting would continue to last a total of four more years until the signing of Jerusalem Cease Fire of 2030, which brought a halt to the bloodshed.

The agreement was largely one-sided however, as the AAF had emerged victorious while the loyalists were rendered completely irrelevant by the war's end. As well as bringing a conclusive end to the fighting, the agreement gave global recognition to Akhanteros' cabinet as the legitimate government of the Republic of Altis and Stratis.

### Equipment
Most of the AAF's hardware consists of outdated or long-since decommissioned for service equipment used by NATO forces. Troopers wear a mixture of early 21st century U.S. Army ACU-style uniforms patterned in a fractal digital green camouflage, while standard-issue combat helmets are old PASGT helmets that have been modified to mount night vision goggles.

The service rifle of all AAF troopers and support personnel is the Mk20 bullpup assault rifle that is chambered to fire the 5.56 mm NATO cartridge. For additional or precision firepower, the AAF also utilises the Mk200 light machine gun and Mk18 ABR battle rifle for either role (respectively).

At both the squad and company level, AAF weapon teams utilise the Titan MPRL for anti-aircraft purposes, while the Titan MPRL Compact, PCML, and MAAWS Mk4 Mod 0 launchers are used for anti-tank/anti-vehicle duties. On occasion, even CSAT RPG-42s have been utilised by AAF AT troopers; though generally in fewer numbers due to the prevalence of the PCML and MAAWS Mk4 launchers instead.<br>

## LDF
The <b>Livonian Defense Force (shortened to LDF)</b> is an Independent faction in ArmA 3. It was added with the release of the Contact DLC.

### History
The collapse of the Soviet Union paved the way for Livonia regaining its independence in 1991. Towards the start of the 21st century, the country would also become an official member of the NATO alliance. Since then, the Livonian Defense Force has participated in numerous deployments alongside its allies throughout the globe.

As tensions with Livonia's neighbours continue to rise in light of CSAT expansionism in nearby Belarus, the LDF's role has transitioned to safeguarding the nation's borders against potential infiltration attempts from both the Russian Federation and Belarus.

Arma3-faction-nato-00
In recent years, safeguarding the nation's borders against Russian/Belorussian subversion attempts has become top priority of both the LDF and its allies' agenda.

In late 2035, the Livonian government reached an agreement with its NATO partners to have the biennial "Electron" joint training exercises be held on a consistent basis in the country's semi-abandoned Nadbór region.

The latest of the exercises, Electron-39, will begin on June 17th, 2039. It will be the largest exercise yet, with over 25,000 personnel from both the LDF and its allies participating.

The LDF and their allies will be alternating between roleplaying as the aggressor force, simulating an armed incursion by the Russian military into the so-called "Andrzejów Gap" region.

### Equipment
As an active member of the NATO alliance, the LDF's soldiers are well-equipped with some of the latest in Western-made hardware and electronics.

Conventional Livonian infantry don combat fatigues, ballistic helmets and plate carrier vests coloured in either a plain olive green colour or concealed with the LDF's distinctive "geometric" woodland camouflage pattern.

Non-combat support troops on the other hand, often wear lighter versions of the standard fatigues but only don bandoliers or lightweight bullet-resistant vests instead. On the rare occasion that NBC safety is required, military scientists and regular soldiers wear full-body protective suits and respirators designed to shield them against contamination from biological/chemical agents.

While the majority of ground troops have access to night vision equipment like their American and British counterparts, only the LDF's elite special operations units and pathfinders are given ENVG-II multi-vision goggles.

## NATO
<b>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (alternately known as the North Atlantic Alliance and shortened to NATO or OTAN in French)</b> is a multi-national BLUFOR faction that has been featured in ArmA: Cold War Assault, ArmA 2 and ArmA 3.

### History
Two decades of geopolitical turmoil after the events of Operation Arrowhead have seen a drastic reduction to NATO's influence on world affairs.

In the subsequent power vacuum, the Canton Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty (CSAT), a coalition of Eastern nations led by the People's Republic of China, has risen to assume its place.

Economic issues continue to plague many of the core NATO members. A two decade-long depression in the United States, as well as throughout the European continent, has set into motion an irreversible dwindling of Western European soft power.

Germany, once considered the economic heart of Europe, suffers from a staggering 33% unemployment rate while other European countries average higher at 42%. Mass rioting in capital cities occur on a regular basis, necessitating the deployment of soldiers and often culminating in bloodshed.

The U.S. has been equally impacted by the depression, with its economy shrinking at the turn of every financial quarter. Combined with constant military defeats in proxy wars against China in the Asia-Pacific region, and elsewhere in the globe, these losses have contributed to a sharp rise in isolationist sentiments.

With the alliance collectively struggling to tackle domestic issues, many of its members have opted to shy away from foreign deployments. This has resulted in the U.S. being stretched thin militarily, and unable to secure its traditional spheres of influence against CSAT expansionism.

Prior to the start of the events of The East Wind, the alliance has already been severely fragmented. Several Southern European nations are facing total economic collapse, while many of its Eastern European members have opted to leave the organisation on the promise of receiving Russian oil.

### Equipment
Predominately consisting of infantrymen from the U.S. Army, NATO forces wear plate carriers and helmets which offer decent protection to the head and torso at the cost of storage capacity.

Conventional troops wear a mixture of light and blast-resistant carrier vests. Squad leaders and some specialist troops on the other hand, prefer to don special plate carriers made out of ceramic materials. Combat helmets range from Light, Enhanced and Camouflaged variants, which are standard issue across all NATO forces.

Soldiers deployed to the Mediterranean theatre wear MTP-camouflaged uniforms with ranger green-coloured vests and a variety of spraypainted helmets, while soldiers operating in the Pacific are issued Tropic-camouflaged uniforms, vests and headgear instead.

Lastly, troops based in mainland Europe utilise Woodland-camouflaged uniforms and personal gear specially tailored for the heavily-forested landscapes of Eastern Europe.

Depending on whether NBC threats to humans are present, MOPP gear may also be distributed to line infantry in the form of protective suits and respirators with gas masks. Intended to shield them against the hazards of a contaminated battlefield, these cumbersome (but essential) pieces of equipment are available to all NATO forces regardless of the region they operate in.
